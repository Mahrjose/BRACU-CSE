## Course Project

In CSE423, we were required to develop a game as our final course project. There were some restrictions, such as being allowed to use only `GL_POINTS`, and we also had to choose a game that was significantly different from those of our peers. I decided to recreate the classic Tetris game.

Here's the project â€“ [Tetrix](https://github.com/Mahrjose/Tetrix)
